                                    Ingredients:
                                    •	1 pound Italian sausage (spicy or mild), casings removed
                                    •	1 onion, chopped
                                    •	3 cloves garlic, minced
                                    •	4 cups chicken broth
                                    •	4 cups water
                                    •	2 large potatoes, diced
                                    •	1 bunch kale, stems removed and leaves chopped
                                    •	1 cup heavy cream
                                    •	Salt and pepper to taste
                                    •	Red pepper flakes (optional, for added heat)
                                    •	Grated Parmesan cheese for serving
                                    <p> Instructions:
                                        <p> 1.	In a large pot or Dutch oven, brown the Italian sausage over medium heat, breaking it up into small pieces as it cooks. Once browned, remove any excess fat from the pot.
                                            <p>  2.	Add the chopped onion to the pot and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes.
                                                <p>  3.	Pour in the chicken broth and water, then add the diced potatoes. Bring the soup to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are tender, about 15-20 minutes.
                                                    <p>  4.	Once the potatoes are cooked, add the chopped kale to the pot and simmer for another 5 minutes, until the kale is wilted.
                                                        <p>  5.	Stir in the heavy cream and season the soup with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using), adjusting to taste.
                                                            <p>  6.	Allow the soup to simmer for a few more minutes to heat through. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.
                                                                <p>  7.	Serve the Zuppa Toscana soup hot, garnished with grated Parmesan cheese. Enjoy!
                                    Feel free to customize the recipe by using different types of sausage or adding additional vegetables like carrots or celery.
