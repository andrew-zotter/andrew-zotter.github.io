                                    •	1 tablespoon olive oil
                                    •	1 onion, chopped
                                    •	3 cloves garlic, minced
                                    •	1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, diced
                                    •	2 cans (15 ounces each) white beans (such as cannellini or great northern), drained and rinsed
                                    •	1 can (4 ounces) diced green chilies
                                    •	4 cups chicken broth
                                    •	1 teaspoon ground cumin
                                    •	1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
                                    •	1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)
                                    •	Salt and pepper to taste
                                    •	1/2 cup heavy cream or half-and-half
                                    •	Fresh cilantro, chopped, for garnish (optional)
                                    •	Shredded Monterey Jack cheese, for garnish (optional)
                                    •	Lime wedges, for serving (optional)
                                    <p>  Instructions:
                                        <p>  1.	In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant.
                                            <p>  2.	Add the diced chicken breasts to the pot and cook until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes.
                                                <p>  3.	Stir in the white beans, diced green chilies, chicken broth, ground cumin, dried oregano, and cayenne pepper (if using). Season with salt and pepper to taste.
                                                    <p>   4.	Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for about 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together and the chicken to cook through.
                                                        <p>   5.	Once the soup has simmered, stir in the heavy cream or half-and-half. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.
                                                            <p>   6.	Allow the soup to simmer for a few more minutes to heat through.
                                                                <p>   7.	Serve the creamy white chicken chili soup hot, garnished with chopped fresh cilantro and shredded Monterey Jack cheese if desired. Serve with lime wedges on the side for squeezing over the soup, if desired. Enjoy!
                                    Feel free to customize the recipe by adding additional vegetables like diced bell peppers or corn kernels. You can also adjust the level of spiciness by adding more or less cayenne pepper.
