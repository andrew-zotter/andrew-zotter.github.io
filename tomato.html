                                <p>
                               Ingredients:
                                •	2 tablespoons olive oil
                                •	1 onion, chopped
                                •	2 cloves garlic, minced
                                •	2 cans (14 oz each) diced tomatoes
                                •	1 can (14 oz) tomato sauce
                                •	2 cups vegetable or chicken broth
                                •	1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, chopped (plus extra for garnish)
                                •	Salt and pepper to taste
                                •	Optional: 1/4 cup heavy cream or coconut milk for creaminess (optional)
                                <p>  Instructions:
                                    <p>  1.	In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant.
                                        <p>  2.	Pour in the diced tomatoes (with their juices), tomato sauce, and vegetable or chicken broth. Stir to combine.
                                            <p>   3.	Bring the soup to a simmer and let it cook for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
                                                <p>  4.	Once the soup has simmered, stir in the chopped basil leaves. If desired, you can also add the heavy cream or coconut milk at this stage for added creaminess.
                                                    <p>  5.	Using an immersion blender or transferring the soup to a blender in batches, blend until smooth. Be careful when blending hot liquids.
                                                        <p>  6.	Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste.
                                                            <p>  7.	Serve the tomato basil soup hot, garnished with additional chopped basil leaves if desired. Enjoy with crusty bread or a grilled cheese sandwich for a comforting meal!
                                Feel free to adjust the consistency of the soup by adding more broth if you prefer a thinner soup, or simmering longer to thicken it up. You can also add a pinch of sugar if the tomatoes are too acidic for your taste.
